Object Prevalence Model (OPM)

OPM does to data what functional programming did to state - data are immutable.

OPM is a DSL and runtime for managing durable object state as a timeline of changes. Sort of like
a 'git for data models', OPM allows all previous versions of an object to be recoverable. OPM
has also shown a number of nice features beyond simple immutable timelines such as: a clean
abstraction for auditing changes, a novel approach to managing state machine for distributed
interaction and a new way to apply the builder pattern without case classes.
